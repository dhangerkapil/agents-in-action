    "1. **Automatic Lifecycle Management**: When no Agent ID is provided, the agent is automatically created and cleaned up\n",
    "2. **Function Tools**: Agents can use custom functions to perform specific tasks (like getting weather data)\n",
    "3. **Authentication**: Uses Azure CLI credentials for authentication (make sure to run `az login` first)\n",
    "4. **Response Types**: \n",
    "   - Non-streaming: Get complete response at once using `agent.run()`\n",
    "   - Streaming: Get response chunks as they're generated using `agent.run_stream()`\n",
    "5. **Context Managers**: Using `async with` ensures proper resource cleanup"
