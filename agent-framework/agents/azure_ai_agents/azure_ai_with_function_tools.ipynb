    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agent-Level Tools**: Tools defined at agent creation are available for all queries\n",
    "2. **Run-Level Tools**: Tools can be provided per query for specific functionality\n",
    "3. **Mixed Approach**: Combine both patterns for maximum flexibility\n",
    "4. **Tool Selection**: Agents intelligently choose which tools to use based on query context\n",
    "5. **Multiple Tools**: Agents can coordinate multiple tools to answer complex queries\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**: Tools should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Descriptions**: Use descriptive field annotations for better tool selection\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in tool functions\n",
    "3. **Tool Scope**: Choose between agent-level and run-level tools based on usage patterns\n",
    "4. **Type Annotations**: Use proper type hints for better tool integration\n",
    "5. **Documentation**: Provide clear docstrings for tool functions\n",
    "6. **Testing**: Test tools individually before integrating with agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Information Retrieval**: Weather, time, and data lookup tools\n",
    "- **Calculations**: Mathematical and conversion tools\n",
    "- **Data Processing**: Tools for analyzing and transforming data\n",
    "- **External APIs**: Tools that integrate with external services\n",
    "- **Utility Functions**: Common utility functions for various tasks"
