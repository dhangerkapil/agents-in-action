    "\n",
    "Before running this notebook, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Azure AI Project**: Access to an Azure AI Foundry project with deployed models\n",
    "2. **Authentication**: Azure CLI installed and authenticated (`az login --use-device-code`)\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Threads**: Threads can persist beyond a single session, enabling conversation continuity\n",
    "2. **Thread Initialization**: Always verify that threads are properly initialized before use\n",
    "3. **Conversation Context**: Threads maintain conversation history, allowing for contextual responses\n",
    "4. **Resource Management**: Always clean up threads when they're no longer needed\n",
    "5. **Multi-Threading**: You can manage multiple separate conversations using different thread IDs\n",
    "6. **Thread Reuse**: Threads can be reused across different agent instances\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thread Lifecycle**: Create threads when starting conversations and delete them when finished\n",
    "2. **Error Handling**: Use try-finally blocks to ensure thread cleanup\n",
    "3. **Thread Validation**: Always check if threads are initialized before using them\n",
    "4. **Context Awareness**: Leverage thread history for more contextual conversations\n",
    "5. **Resource Monitoring**: Monitor thread usage to avoid unnecessary resource consumption\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Maintaining conversation history across support sessions\n",
    "- **Multi-Session Chats**: Continuing conversations across different user sessions\n",
    "- **Conversation Branching**: Managing multiple conversation topics simultaneously\n",
    "- **Context Preservation**: Keeping conversation context for better user experience\n",
    "- **Session Management**: Managing different conversation sessions for different users"
