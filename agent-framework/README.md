## Overview

The Microsoft Agent Framework is the next generation of tooling from the Semantic Kernel and AutoGen teams. It provides a unified programming model for building intelligent agents, multi-agent workflows, and connected tools in both Python and .NET. These samples showcase core scenarios ranging from single-agent chat to advanced orchestration with state management, custom memory, and production telemetry.

> The framework is currently in public preview. Expect APIs and package names to evolve.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or later
- An Azure subscription with access to Azure AI Foundry (for Azure-hosted samples)
- Azure CLI 2.60+ with an active `az login` session
- Optional: Redis (for distributed thread samples) and Application Insights (for telemetry notebooks)

## Environment Setup

1. **Install packages**  
   Most samples work with the preview roll-up package:
   ```bash
   pip install agent-framework --pre
   ```
   For slimmer environments you can install the specific integrations you need, for example:
   ```bash
   pip install agent-framework-core --pre
   pip install agent-framework-azure-ai --pre
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**  
   Copy the sample file and update the values with your Azure resources:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Minimum variables:
   ```
   AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT="https://<project-name>.<region>.copilot.azure.com"
   AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<deployment-name>"
   AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<subscription-id>"
   ```
   Some notebooks require additional settings such as `BING_CONNECTION_ID` (web grounding) or Redis connection strings (threading samples). The notebook markdown cells call out anything extra.

3. **Verify authentication**  
   Run `az account show` to confirm the CLI is signed in and targeting the correct subscription.

## Running the Notebooks

1. Activate your Python virtual environment.
2. Open the notebook you want to explore and execute the cells in order. Most notebooks include setup cells that validate credentials before the scenarios run.

## Repository Guide

### `agents/azure_ai_agents/`
Single-agent patterns for the Azure AI chat client. Highlights:
- `azure_ai_basic.ipynb` introduces the agent lifecycle using service-managed storage.
- `azure_ai_with_function_tools.ipynb` demonstrates tool invocation and structured tool output.
- `azure_ai_with_file_search.ipynb` shows retrieval augmented generation with Azure AI file search.
- `azure_ai_with_code_interpreter.ipynb` enables Python code execution within conversations.
See `agents/azure_ai_agents/README.md` for the complete walkthrough and detailed setup instructions.

### `agents/mcp/`
Model Context Protocol examples that connect Agent Framework to external systems:
- `azure_ai_with_mcp.ipynb` drives an Azure AI agent through the MCP client stack.
- `agent_as_mcp_server.py` exposes an agent as an MCP server that other clients can query.
- `mcp_api_key_auth.py` illustrates securing MCP servers with API keys.

### `context_providers/`
Memory and context management recipes:
- `1-azure_ai_memory_context_providers.ipynb` extracts, stores, and re-injects conversation facts using the `ContextProvider` APIs.
The accompanying README outlines provider lifecycles and extension points.

### `threads/`
Conversation threading and persistence:
- `1-azure-ai-thread-serialization.ipynb` shows how Azure AI Foundry manages server-side history.
- `2-custom_chat_message_store_thread.ipynb` builds a custom `ChatMessageStoreProtocol`.
- `3-redis_chat_message_store_thread.ipynb` persists messages to Redis for distributed workloads.
- `4-suspend_resume_thread.ipynb` suspends and resumes threads across sessions.
Refer to `threads/README.md` for architecture notes and troubleshooting tips.

### `middleware/`
Nine notebooks that cover interception patterns for agents and workflows:
- Request/response interception (`1-agent_and_run_level_middleware.ipynb`)
- Function-based and class-based middleware (`2-` and `3-` prefixed notebooks)
- Error handling, termination, and result overrides (`6-` through `8-`)
A short README describes when to choose each middleware style.

### `observability/`
Operational telemetry examples:
- `1-azure_ai_agent_observability.ipynb` emits OpenTelemetry traces for agent runs.
- `2-azure_ai_chat_client_with_observability.ipynb` wires telemetry into lower-level chat clients.
These scenarios focus on Application Insights, but also illustrate custom span annotations.

### `workflows/`
Graph-based orchestration examples (40+ notebooks) arranged by topic:
- `_start-here/` progressive introduction to executors, edges, and streaming.
- `agents/`, `orchestration/`, and `parallelism/` demonstrate complex control flow and coordination.
- `checkpoint/` and `state-management/` show long-running workflow patterns.
- `human-in-the-loop/` and `observability/` bring humans and telemetry into workflow runs.
Start with `_start-here/notebooks/step1_executors_and_edges.ipynb` and move into the thematic folders. The folder-level README provides a map for all scenarios.

### `devui/`
A lightweight web experience for exploring agents and workflows:
- `in_memory_mode.py` spins up DevUI with local in-memory data.
- Running `devui` discovers agents and workflows on disk and serves them at `http://localhost:8080/`.
Great for demos or rapid iteration without wiring up a full application.

## Suggested Learning Path

1. **Foundations** — Work through `agents/azure_ai_agents/azure_ai_basic.ipynb` and `azure_ai_with_explicit_settings.ipynb`.
2. **Persistence** — Explore the `threads/` notebooks to understand message storage and resume patterns.
3. **Memory** — Add contextual memory using `context_providers/1-azure_ai_memory_context_providers.ipynb`.
4. **Tooling & Integration** — Connect agents to external systems via `agents/mcp/`.
5. **Workflows** — Combine everything in `workflows/_start-here/` before branching into advanced orchestration topics.
6. **Observability** — Instrument runs with the `observability/` notebooks.
7. **Middleware** — Implement cross-cutting concerns with the `middleware/` series.
8. **Interactive UI** — Use `devui/` to demo or validate your agents with a browser-based client.

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication failures** — Re-run `az login` and confirm your Azure subscription has the required Azure AI permissions.
- **Missing environment variables** — Verify `.env` mirrors the keys called out in notebook setup cells.
- **Package import errors** — Ensure the `agent-framework` packages were installed into the same interpreter that launches Jupyter.
- **Redis connectivity** — Update the connection string in the Redis samples and confirm the service is reachable before running the notebook cells.
- **Application Insights ingestion delay** — Telemetry can take a few minutes to appear in the Azure portal; use the Live Metrics Stream for near-real-time debugging.
