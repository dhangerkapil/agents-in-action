    "# Shared States with Agents and Conditional Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates advanced **state management** in the Agent Framework, showing how to use **shared state** to decouple large payloads from messages, enforce **structured agent outputs** with Pydantic models, and implement **conditional routing** based on agent decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared State Management\n",
    "- **State Persistence**: Store large objects in workflow context instead of passing through edges\n",
    "- **Lightweight References**: Pass only IDs between executors, load data on demand\n",
    "- **State Namespacing**: Use prefixes (`email:`) to organize related state objects\n",
    "- **Async State Operations**: `set_shared_state()` and `get_shared_state()` for context sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Agent Outputs\n",
    "- **Pydantic Models**: Define expected agent response schemas\n",
    "- **Response Format Enforcement**: `response_format` parameter ensures JSON structure\n",
    "- **Type Safety**: Automatic validation and parsing of agent outputs\n",
    "- **Robust Parsing**: Prevents errors from unstructured or malformed responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Routing\n",
    "- **Dynamic Branching**: Route based on runtime data (spam vs. non-spam)\n",
    "- **Condition Predicates**: Functions that evaluate message content\n",
    "- **Type-Safe Routing**: Conditional edges based on typed messages\n",
    "- **Guard Clauses**: Executors validate they receive expected message types\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Email Spam Detection and Reply Drafting\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow processes incoming emails with two possible paths:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path 1 - Spam Email:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "store_email → spam_detection_agent → to_detection_result → handle_spam ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Path 2 - Legitimate Email:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "store_email → spam_detection_agent → to_detection_result → \n",
    "submit_to_email_assistant → email_assistant_agent → finalize_and_send ✅\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Example Shows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State-Based Architecture**: Large email payloads stored once, referenced by ID\n",
    "2. **Structured Agent Responses**: Pydantic models enforce JSON schema from agents\n",
    "3. **Conditional Branching**: Workflow routes based on spam detection result\n",
    "4. **Composition Patterns**: Mix agent executors with function executors\n",
    "5. **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Enterprise-ready AI agent configuration\n",
    "6. **Event Streaming**: Monitor workflow execution in real-time"

    "### Expected Output for Spam Email:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Final result: Email marked as spam: This email exhibits several common spam and scam \n",
    "characteristics: unrealistic claims of large cash winnings, urgent time pressure, requests \n",
    "for sensitive personal and financial information, and a demand for a processing fee. The \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Spam Detection Accuracy**:\n",

    "   - Detailed reasoning explains the classification\n",
    "   - Mentions specific red flags (urgency, suspicious links, etc.)\n",

    "2. **Conditional Routing Success**:\n",

    "4. **Structured Output Validation**:\n",
    "   - Agent returned valid JSON matching DetectionResultAgent schema\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shared State Management\n",
    "- ✅ **Decouple Data from Messages**: Store large payloads in shared state, pass IDs\n",
    "- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Email content stored once, referenced multiple times\n",
    "- ✅ **Flexible Architecture**: Easy to add email history or multi-email workflows\n",
    "- ✅ **Async State Operations**: Non-blocking `set_shared_state()` and `get_shared_state()`\n",
    "- ✅ **State Namespacing**: Prefixes (`email:`) organize related objects\n",
    "- ✅ **Type-Safe State**: Store and retrieve strongly typed objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Agent Outputs\n",
    "- ✅ **Pydantic Models**: Define expected JSON schemas for agent responses\n",
    "- ✅ **Response Format Enforcement**: `response_format` parameter ensures structure\n",
    "- ✅ **Automatic Validation**: Pydantic validates JSON against model\n",
    "- ✅ **Type Safety**: Downstream code can safely access validated fields\n",
    "- ✅ **Error Prevention**: Malformed responses caught early by validation\n",
    "- ✅ **Clear Contracts**: Models document agent output expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Routing\n",
    "- ✅ **Dynamic Branching**: Route based on runtime data (spam vs. non-spam)\n",
    "- ✅ **Condition Predicates**: Functions evaluate message content for routing\n",
    "- ✅ **Type-Safe Routing**: Check message types before accessing fields\n",
    "- ✅ **Guard Clauses**: Executors validate expected message types\n",
    "- ✅ **Fail-Safe Design**: Non-matching messages pass through to avoid dead ends\n",
    "- ✅ **Multiple Paths**: Different workflows for different classification results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Composition\n",
    "- ✅ **Mixed Executors**: Combine agent executors with function executors\n",
    "- ✅ **Agent Integration**: AgentExecutor for AI-powered processing\n",
    "- ✅ **Function Executors**: Custom logic for routing, validation, and formatting\n",
    "- ✅ **Message Transformation**: Convert between agent responses and internal types\n",
    "- ✅ **WorkflowBuilder API**: Fluent interface for graph construction\n",
    "\n",
    "### Azure OpenAI Integration\n",
    "- ✅ **Enterprise Authentication**: AzureCliCredential for secure access\n",
    "- ✅ **Agent Configuration**: System instructions define behavior\n",
    "- ✅ **Structured Outputs**: JSON schema enforcement via `response_format`\n",
    "- ✅ **Chat Client**: Manages agent lifecycle and requests\n",
    "- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Endpoint and deployment from env vars\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Streaming and Observability\n",
    "- ✅ **Workflow Events**: `workflow.run()` returns execution events\n",
    "- ✅ **Output Collection**: `events.get_outputs()` extracts results\n",
    "- ✅ **Real-Time Monitoring**: Stream events as workflow executes\n",
    "- ✅ **Debugging Support**: Events provide execution traces\n",
    "- ✅ **Result Aggregation**: Multiple outputs can be yielded and collected\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern\n",
    "- ✅ Processing large payloads with multiple processing steps\n",
    "- ✅ AI-powered classification with conditional workflows\n",
    "- ✅ Need structured, validated outputs from LLMs\n",
    "- ✅ Multi-path workflows based on runtime decisions\n",
    "- ✅ Enterprise applications requiring type safety and validation\n",
    "- ✅ Workflows with complex state management requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "- 🎯 **Use Shared State for Large Data**: Avoid duplicating payloads in messages\n",
    "- 🎯 **Namespace State Keys**: Prevent collisions and organize data\n",
    "- 🎯 **Enforce Structured Outputs**: Use Pydantic models with `response_format`\n",
    "- 🎯 **Add Guard Clauses**: Validate message types in executors\n",
    "- 🎯 **Design Fail-Safe Conditions**: Allow non-matching messages to pass\n",
    "- 🎯 **Document State Schema**: Comment state key patterns and types\n",
    "- 🎯 **Validate Early**: Parse and validate at routing points\n",
    "- 🎯 **Enrich Data Progressively**: Add context (like email_id) as workflow progresses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Optimization\n",
    "- 🚀 Store frequently accessed data in shared state\n",
    "- 🚀 Use UUIDs for efficient state lookups\n",
    "- 🚀 Minimize message size by passing references\n",
    "- 🚀 Leverage async state operations for concurrency\n",
    "- 🚀 Cache agent responses when appropriate\n",
    "- 🚀 Use structured outputs to avoid retry loops\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "- Add email history tracking with multiple emails in state\n",
    "- Implement more sophisticated spam detection (ML models, rules)\n",
