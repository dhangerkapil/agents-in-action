    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **human-in-the-loop (HITL)** workflows - a pattern where an AI agent alternates turns with a human to collaboratively solve a problem. This interactive guessing game showcases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **RequestInfoExecutor**: Pause workflow for human input\n",
    "2. **Request/Response Correlation**: Match human replies to specific requests\n",
    "3. **Structured Agent Output**: Enforce JSON schema with `response_format`\n",
    "4. **Turn-Based Coordination**: Orchestrate agent ↔ human cycles\n",
    "5. **Event-Driven Streaming**: Real-time interaction via workflow events\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **TurnManager (Custom Executor)**\n",
    "   - Coordinates game flow\n",
    "   - Handles agent responses\n",
    "   - Processes human feedback\n",
    "   - Determines game completion\n",

    "2. **AgentExecutor**\n",
    "   - Wraps Azure OpenAI ChatAgent\n",
    "   - Generates guesses with structured output\n",
    "   - Adjusts based on feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RequestInfoExecutor**\n",
    "   - Pauses workflow for human input\n",
    "   - Emits `RequestInfoEvent` with typed request\n",
    "   - Resumes when application provides `RequestResponse`\n",
    "   - Maintains request/response correlation\n",

    "## Understanding RequestInfoExecutor\n",
    "\n",
    "### What RequestInfoExecutor Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "`RequestInfoExecutor` is a **workflow-native bridge** that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Pauses the workflow graph** at a request for information\n",
    "2. **Emits `RequestInfoEvent`** with a typed payload (e.g., `HumanFeedbackRequest`)\n",
    "3. **Resumes the workflow** only after application supplies matching `RequestResponse`\n",
    "4. **Maintains correlation** via `request_id` key\n",
    "\n",
    "### What RequestInfoExecutor Does NOT Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Does NOT gather input itself** - Your application is responsible\n",
    "- **Does NOT have a UI** - You build the interface\n",
    "- **Does NOT store responses** - You provide them via `send_responses_streaming()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standardizes pause-and-resume** human gating\n",
    "- **Carries typed request payloads** (via RequestInfoMessage subclasses)\n",
    "- **Preserves correlation** (request_id → response mapping)\n",
    "- **Integrates seamlessly** with workflow graph\n",
    "\n",
    "### Request/Response Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Workflow emits request\n",
    "await ctx.send_message(HumanFeedbackRequest(prompt=\"...\", guess=5))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. RequestInfoExecutor emits RequestInfoEvent\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Human-in-the-Loop Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Components:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# 1. Define request schema\n",
    "@dataclass\n",
    "class HumanFeedbackRequest(RequestInfoMessage):\n",
    "    prompt: str\n",
    "    guess: int | None = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Send request in handler\n",
    "await ctx.send_message(HumanFeedbackRequest(prompt=\"...\", guess=5))\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Add RequestInfoExecutor to workflow\n",
    "request_info = RequestInfoExecutor(id=\"request_info\")\n",
    "builder.add_edge(turn_manager, request_info)\n",
    "builder.add_edge(request_info, turn_manager)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. Process RequestInfoEvent\n",
    "if isinstance(event, RequestInfoEvent):\n",
    "    request_id = event.request_id\n",
    "    prompt = event.data.prompt\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 5. Collect human input\n",
    "human_reply = input(prompt)\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6. Resume workflow\n",
    "responses = {request_id: human_reply}\n",
    "await workflow.send_responses_streaming(responses)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. RequestInfoExecutor Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Benefit |\n",
    "|---------|--------|\n",
    "| **Typed Requests** | Strong typing via RequestInfoMessage subclasses |\n",
    "| **Correlation** | Automatic request_id → response mapping |\n",
    "| **Context Preservation** | RequestResponse includes original request |\n",
    "| **Workflow Integration** | Standard executor, works with edges |\n",
    "| **Pause/Resume** | Clean workflow suspension mechanism |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Request/Response Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why correlation matters:**\n",
    "- No shared state needed\n",
    "- Context travels with messages\n",
    "- Multiple concurrent requests supported\n",
    "- Type-safe request/response pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@handler\n",
    "async def on_human_feedback(\n",
    "    self,\n",
    "    feedback: RequestResponse[HumanFeedbackRequest, str],\n",
    "    ctx: WorkflowContext[...]\n",
    ") -> None:\n",
    "    # Access human's reply\n",
    "    reply = feedback.data  # \"higher\", \"lower\", \"correct\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Access original request context\n",
    "    last_guess = feedback.original_request.guess\n",
    "    prompt = feedback.original_request.prompt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Structured Output with response_format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without `response_format` (fragile):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Agent might return: \"I guess 5\" or \"My guess is: 5\" or \"5\"\n",
    "text = agent_response.text\n",
    "guess = int(re.search(r'\\d+', text).group())  # Brittle regex parsing\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With `response_format` (reliable):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class GuessOutput(BaseModel):\n",
    "    guess: int\n",
    "\n",
    "agent = chat_client.create_agent(\n",
    "    instructions=\"...\",\n",
    "    response_format=GuessOutput  # Enforce schema\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Agent returns: {\"guess\": 5}\n",
    "output = GuessOutput.model_validate_json(agent_response.text)\n",
    "guess = output.guess  # Type-safe, validated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Workflow State Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "**State Transitions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "START\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "IN_PROGRESS\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "IN_PROGRESS_PENDING_REQUESTS (request emitted)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "IDLE_WITH_PENDING_REQUESTS (awaiting human)\n",
    "  ↓ (human provides response)\n",
    "IN_PROGRESS (resume)\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "COMPLETED (output yielded)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Monitoring states:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for event in events:\n",
    "    if isinstance(event, WorkflowStatusEvent):\n",
    "        if event.state == WorkflowRunState.IDLE_WITH_PENDING_REQUESTS:\n",
    "            print(\"Waiting for human input...\")\n",
    "        elif event.state == WorkflowRunState.IN_PROGRESS_PENDING_REQUESTS:\n",
    "            print(\"Request being processed...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. TurnManager Design Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "**Responsibilities:**\n",
    "- **Initialize**: Start the interaction\n",
    "- **Coordinate**: Route messages between agent and human\n",
    "- **Process**: Handle responses from both parties\n",
    "- **Decide**: Determine when to continue vs. complete\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-handler pattern:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TurnManager(Executor):\n",
    "    @handler  # Handles str input (start)\n",
    "    async def start(self, _: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[...]) -> None:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @handler  # Handles AgentExecutorResponse\n",
    "    async def on_agent_response(self, result: AgentExecutorResponse, ctx: WorkflowContext[...]) -> None:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @handler  # Handles RequestResponse[HumanFeedbackRequest, str]\n",
    "    async def on_human_feedback(self, feedback: RequestResponse[...], ctx: WorkflowContext[...]) -> None:\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Production HITL Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Web API Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI, BackgroundTasks\n",
    "\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Store pending requests\n",
    "pending_requests: dict[str, dict] = {}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/workflow/start\")\n",
    "async def start_workflow(task: str):\n",
    "    workflow_id = generate_workflow_id()\n",
    "    # Start workflow in background\n",
    "    asyncio.create_task(run_workflow(workflow_id, task))\n",
    "    return {\"workflow_id\": workflow_id}\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.get(\"/workflow/{workflow_id}/pending\")\n",
    "async def get_pending_requests(workflow_id: str):\n",
    "    return pending_requests.get(workflow_id, [])\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.post(\"/workflow/{workflow_id}/respond\")\n",
    "async def submit_response(workflow_id: str, request_id: str, response: str):\n",
    "    await provide_response(workflow_id, {request_id: response})\n",
    "    return {\"status\": \"submitted\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notification Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async def notify_user_on_request(event: RequestInfoEvent):\n",
    "    if isinstance(event.data, HumanFeedbackRequest):\n",
    "        # Send email/Slack/SMS\n",
    "        await send_notification(\n",
    "            user=\"user@company.com\",\n",
    "            subject=\"Input Required\",\n",
    "            body=event.data.prompt\n",
    "        )\n",

    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Subclass `RequestInfoMessage` for type safety\n",
    "- Include context in request (e.g., `guess` field)\n",
    "- Clear, actionable prompts\n",
    "- Validate response format\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Use generic string requests without structure\n",
    "- Rely on external state for context\n",
    "- Ambiguous instructions\n",
    "- Forget response validation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow Design\n",
    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Use `response_format` for structured agent output\n",
    "- Add RequestInfoExecutor edges explicitly\n",
    "- Handle all event types (RequestInfoEvent, WorkflowOutputEvent, WorkflowStatusEvent)\n",
    "- Provide clear completion conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Parse agent output with regex\n",
    "- Forget to wire RequestInfoExecutor in graph\n",
    "- Ignore workflow state transitions\n",
    "- Create infinite loops without exit conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Production\n",
    "✅ **Do:**\n",
    "- Implement timeout handling\n",
    "- Store requests persistently\n",
    "- Send notifications for pending requests\n",
    "- Audit all human responses\n",
    "- Support multiple concurrent requests\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't:**\n",
    "- Block indefinitely waiting for human\n",
    "- Lose requests on server restart\n",
    "- Assume humans will respond immediately\n",
    "- Skip logging/auditing\n",
    "- Assume sequential request processing"
