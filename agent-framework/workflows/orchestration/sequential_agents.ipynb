    "# Sequential Workflow with Shared Conversation Context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **sequential orchestration** using the `SequentialBuilder` API. Unlike concurrent workflows where agents work in parallel, sequential workflows pass a shared conversation context through each participant in order. Each agent appends its response to the growing conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SequentialBuilder**: High-level API for building linear workflows\n",
    "2. **Shared Context**: `list[ChatMessage]` flows through all participants\n",
    "3. **Incremental Building**: Each agent sees previous messages\n",
    "4. **Internal Adapters**: Small nodes for input normalization and completion\n",
    "5. **Final Output**: Complete conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Prompt\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[input-conversation adapter]\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Writer Agent\n",

    "    ↓\n",
    "Reviewer Agent\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[to-conversation:reviewer adapter]\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "[complete adapter]\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Final Conversation (list[ChatMessage])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Internal Adapters Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "The sequential orchestration includes small adapter nodes that may appear in the event stream:\n",
    "- **`input-conversation`**: Normalizes input into conversation format\n",
    "- **`to-conversation:<participant>`**: Converts agent response to ChatMessage\n",
    "- **`complete`**: Signals completion and yields final output\n",
    "\n",
    "You can safely ignore these when focusing on agent progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Sequential Orchestration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Iterative refinement**: Each step builds on previous work\n",
    "- **Writer-reviewer patterns**: Draft → Review → Edit flows\n",
    "- **Progressive enhancement**: Incrementally add detail or analysis\n",
    "- **Context-dependent tasks**: Later steps need earlier results\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI configured with environment variables\n",
    "- Azure CLI authentication: Run `az login` before executing\n",
    "- Agent Framework installed: `pip install agent-framework`"

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Sequential Builder Simplicity\n",
    "- One line to create workflow: `SequentialBuilder().participants([...]).build()`\n",
    "- Order of participants defines execution sequence\n",
    "- Automatic conversation management\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Shared Conversation Context\n",
    "- Each agent receives complete `list[ChatMessage]` history\n",
    "- Agents can reference previous responses\n",
    "- Context grows with each participant\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Internal Adapter Nodes\n",
    "- Framework adds helper executors for:\n",
    "  - Input normalization (`input-conversation`)\n",
    "  - Response conversion (`to-conversation:<name>`)\n",
    "  - Completion signaling (`complete`)\n",
    "- These appear in event streams but can be ignored\n",
    "- Similar to concurrent's dispatcher/aggregator\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Message Authorship\n",
    "- `author_name` property identifies which agent responded\n",
    "- User messages have no `author_name` (or generic \"user\")\n",
    "- Assistant messages tagged with agent name\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Output Structure\n",
    "- Final output is `list[ChatMessage]`\n",
    "- Contains all messages in chronological order:\n",
    "  1. User's original prompt\n",
    "  2. Writer's response\n",
    "  3. Reviewer's feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Workflow Completion\n",
    "- Completes when all participants finish\n",
    "- No pending messages to process\n",
    "- Final conversation available via `WorkflowOutputEvent`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Use Cases\n",
    "- **Draft-Review-Edit**: Writer → Reviewer → Editor pipelines\n",
    "- **Progressive Summarization**: Extract → Summarize → Refine\n",
    "- **Multi-stage Analysis**: Research → Analysis → Recommendations\n",
    "- **Iterative Content**: Generate → Critique → Improve\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Comparison with Concurrent\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Sequential | Concurrent |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|------------|\n",
    "| **Execution** | One at a time, in order | All simultaneously |\n",
    "| **Context** | Shared, growing conversation | Independent, parallel |\n",
    "| **Dependencies** | Later steps see earlier results | No inter-agent dependencies |\n",
    "| **Speed** | Slower (serial) | Faster (parallel) |\n",
    "| **Use Case** | Refinement, building context | Independent analysis |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Customization Options\n",
    "- Mix agents and custom executors (see sequential_custom_executors.py)\n",
    "- Add custom processing between agents\n",
    "- Combine with concurrent stages for hybrid workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Production Considerations\n",
    "- Monitor conversation length (token accumulation)\n",
    "- Consider truncation for very long sequences\n",
    "- Add error handling for individual agent failures\n",
    "- Log each agent's contribution separately\n",
    "- Set timeouts for slow agents"
