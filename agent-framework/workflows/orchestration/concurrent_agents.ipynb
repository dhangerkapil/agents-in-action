    "# Concurrent Fan-Out/Fan-In Orchestration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **concurrent orchestration** using the `ConcurrentBuilder` API. Instead of executing agents sequentially, this pattern fans out a single user prompt to multiple domain experts simultaneously, then fans in their responses into a single aggregated output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ConcurrentBuilder**: High-level API for building parallel workflows\n",
    "2. **Fan-Out Pattern**: Same prompt dispatched to multiple agents in parallel\n",
    "3. **Fan-In Aggregation**: Results collected and combined into final output\n",
    "4. **Default Aggregator**: Returns `list[ChatMessage]` with all conversations\n",
    "5. **Workflow Completion**: Finishes when idle with no pending work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "                    User Prompt\n",
    "                        ↓\n",
    "            [Internal Dispatcher]\n",
    "               ↙       ↓        ↘\n",
    "         Researcher  Marketer  Legal\n",
    "         (parallel execution)\n",
    "               ↘       ↓        ↙\n",
    "            [Default Aggregator]\n",
    "                        ↓\n",
    "            Aggregated Output\n",
    "     (list[ChatMessage] from all agents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Concurrent Orchestration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multi-perspective analysis**: Need insights from different domain experts\n",
    "- **Parallel processing**: Tasks that can be executed independently\n",
    "- **Speed optimization**: Reduce total execution time vs. sequential\n",
    "- **Comprehensive coverage**: Gather diverse viewpoints simultaneously\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI configured with environment variables:\n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`\n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`\n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME`\n",
    "  - `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`\n",
    "- Azure CLI authentication: Run `az login` before executing\n",
    "- Agent Framework installed: `pip install agent-framework`"

    "**Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Demographic:** Urban commuters seeking affordable, eco-friendly transport;\n",
    "    likely to include students, young professionals, and price-sensitive urban residents.\n",
    "- **Market Trends:** E-bike sales are growing globally, with increasing urbanization,\n",
    "    higher fuel costs, and sustainability concerns driving adoption.\n",
    "- **Competitive Landscape:** Key competitors include brands like Rad Power Bikes, Aventon,\n",
    "    Lectric, and domestic budget-focused manufacturers in North America, Europe, and Asia.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Concurrent Builder Simplicity\n",
    "- Single line to create workflow: `ConcurrentBuilder().participants([...]).build()`\n",
    "- No manual edge definition required\n",
    "- Automatic dispatcher and aggregator setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Parallel Execution Benefits\n",
    "- **Faster results**: All agents run simultaneously\n",
    "- **Independent analysis**: Each agent provides unique perspective\n",
    "- **Efficient resource use**: No waiting for sequential completion\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Default Aggregation\n",
    "- Returns `list[ChatMessage]` with:\n",
    "  - One user message (original prompt)\n",
    "  - One assistant message per agent (their responses)\n",
    "- Preserves `author_name` for identifying which agent responded\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Workflow Completion\n",
    "- Completes when all participants are idle\n",
    "- No pending messages to process\n",
    "- Outputs accessible via `events.get_outputs()`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Use Cases\n",
    "- **Product launches**: Research + Marketing + Legal perspectives\n",
    "- **Risk assessment**: Multiple domain experts evaluating scenarios\n",
    "- **Content creation**: Diverse viewpoints for comprehensive coverage\n",
    "- **Decision support**: Parallel analysis from different angles\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Agent vs. Executor Participants\n",
    "- Can mix **AgentProtocol** (agents) and **Executor** instances\n",
    "- Agents use default agent executor wrapper\n",
    "- Custom executors provide more control (see concurrent_custom_agent_executors.py)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Customization Options\n",
    "- **Custom aggregator**: Override default with `.with_aggregator(callback)` (see concurrent_custom_aggregator.py)\n",
    "- **Custom dispatcher**: Can replace default dispatcher logic\n",
    "- **Hybrid patterns**: Combine concurrent and sequential stages\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Production Considerations\n",
    "- Monitor total token usage across all parallel agents\n",
    "- Consider rate limits when scaling to many participants\n",
    "- Add error handling for individual agent failures\n",
    "- Log agent responses separately for debugging\n",
    "- Consider timeout handling for slow agents"
