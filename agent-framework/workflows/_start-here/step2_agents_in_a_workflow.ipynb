    "# Step 2: Agents in a Workflow (Non-Streaming)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to integrate AI agents into workflows using the Agent Framework. We'll create a two-agent workflow where:\n",
    "1. **Writer Agent** - Creates or edits content\n",
    "2. **Reviewer Agent** - Evaluates and provides feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Agents as Workflow Executors**: Wrap chat agents created by `AzureOpenAIChatClient` inside workflow executors\n",
    "- **Automatic Output Yielding**: Agents automatically yield outputs when they complete\n",
    "- **Non-Streaming Execution**: Using `workflow.run()` for synchronous results\n",
    "- **Agent Events**: Capturing and displaying agent run events\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Azure OpenAI configured with required environment variables\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Azure CLI authentication (`az login` completed)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Basic familiarity with WorkflowBuilder, executors, and edges"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Agents as Executors**\n",
    "- AI agents created with `create_agent()` can be used directly in workflows\n",
    "- No need for custom executor wrappers\n",
    "- Seamless integration with WorkflowBuilder\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Automatic Output Handling**\n",
    "- Agents automatically yield outputs when they complete\n",
    "- No explicit `ctx.yield_output()` needed\n",
    "- Simplifies workflow construction\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Event-Driven Architecture**\n",
    "- `AgentRunEvent` captures agent responses\n",
    "- Events can be filtered and processed\n",
    "- Full visibility into workflow execution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-Streaming vs Streaming\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Streaming (`workflow.run()`):**\n",
    "- Waits for complete responses\n",
    "- Returns all events at once\n",
    "- Simpler for batch processing\n",
    "- Used in this example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Streaming (`workflow.run_stream()`):**\n",
    "- Real-time response chunks\n",
    "- Better user experience for long responses\n",
    "- Covered in Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates a **Sequential Agent Chain**:\n",
    "```\n",
    "User Input ‚Üí Writer Agent ‚Üí Reviewer Agent ‚Üí Final Output\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases:\n",
    "- Content creation and review\n",
    "- Multi-stage processing pipelines\n",
    "- Quality assurance workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Continue to **Step 3** to learn about streaming responses and real-time output!"
