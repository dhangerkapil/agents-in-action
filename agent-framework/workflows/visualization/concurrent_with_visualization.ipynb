    "# Concurrent Multi-Agent Workflow with Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **fan-out/fan-in pattern** with multiple AI agents working concurrently, combined with **workflow visualization** capabilities using Mermaid diagrams, DiGraph, and SVG export.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fan-Out/Fan-In Pattern\n",
    "- **Fan-Out**: Dispatch the same prompt to multiple domain expert agents simultaneously\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**: All agents process independently and concurrently\n",
    "- **Fan-In**: Aggregate responses from all agents into a consolidated output\n",
    "- **Domain Expertise**: Each agent specializes in a specific area (research, marketing, legal)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Orchestration\n",
    "- **AgentExecutor**: Wraps Azure OpenAI agents with workflow integration\n",
    "- **Target Routing**: `target_id` directs requests to specific agents\n",
    "- **Response Aggregation**: Collect and organize outputs by agent ID\n",
    "- **Structured Output**: Dataclass for organized multi-agent insights\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Visualization\n",
    "- **WorkflowViz**: Generate visual representations of workflow graphs\n",
    "- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Text-based flowcharts for documentation\n",
    "- **DiGraph**: NetworkX graph objects for programmatic analysis\n",
    "- **SVG Export**: High-quality vector graphics (requires GraphViz)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Product Launch Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze a product launch idea from three expert perspectives:\n",
    "\n",

    "**Experts:**\n",

    "- 📈 **Marketer**: Value propositions and target messaging\n",
    "- ⚖️ **Legal**: Compliance, disclaimers, and policy concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Example Shows\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Executors**: Build dispatcher and aggregator with `@handler` decorator\n",
    "2. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Orchestrate three AI agents in parallel\n",
    "3. **Structured Aggregation**: Organize responses into `AggregatedInsights` dataclass\n",
    "4. **Workflow Visualization**: Generate Mermaid, DiGraph, and SVG representations\n",
    "5. **Event Streaming**: Monitor agent execution with `AgentRunEvent`\n",
    "6. **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Enterprise-ready AI agent configuration"
