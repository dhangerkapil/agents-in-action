    "# Simple Loop - Binary Search with Agent Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build **iterative workflows with loops** using the Agent Framework. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Create feedback loops in workflows with agent steps\n",
    "- Implement binary search logic using workflow executors\n",
    "- Use enums for state management and flow control\n",
    "- Integrate AI agents as judges in decision loops\n",
    "- Track iterations and workflow completion\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Sample Does\n",
    "The workflow implements a **number guessing game** using binary search:\n",
    "1. **GuessNumberExecutor** - Performs binary search to guess a target number (1-100)\n",
    "2. **SubmitToJudgeAgent** - Sends guesses to an AI agent judge\n",
    "3. **Judge Agent (LLM)** - Responds with ABOVE/BELOW/MATCHED based on the guess\n",
    "4. **ParseJudgeResponse** - Converts agent response into `NumberSignal` enum\n",
    "5. **Loop** - Continues until the correct number is guessed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Target:** `30` (hardcoded)  \n",
    "**Range:** `1-100`  \n",
    "**Algorithm:** Binary search  \n",
    "**Expected Iterations:** ~7 (log₂(100))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Cyclic Edges:** `add_edge(parse_judge, guess_number)` creates a loop\n",
    "- **State Management:** Executors maintain state (bounds) across loop iterations\n",
    "- **Agent Integration:** LLM judges guesses based on target number\n",
    "- **Enum-Based Flow Control:** `NumberSignal` enum drives decision logic\n",
    "- **Loop Termination:** Workflow completes when `MATCHED` signal is processed"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Creation\n",
    "✅ **Cyclic Edges:** `add_edge(last, first)` creates a feedback loop  \n",
    "✅ **Stateful Executors:** Executors maintain state (bounds) across iterations  \n",
    "✅ **Termination Conditions:** Loops end when no more messages are sent  \n",
    "✅ **Iteration Tracking:** Count specific executor completions to measure iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Search Implementation\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Start with full range (1-100), guess midpoint (50)\n",
    "2. **Feedback:** Judge responds ABOVE/BELOW/MATCHED\n",
    "3. **Update Bounds:** Narrow search space based on feedback\n",
    "4. **New Guess:** Calculate midpoint of updated bounds\n",
    "5. **Repeat:** Continue until MATCHED signal\n",
    "6. **Complexity:** O(log n) - guaranteed to find any number in ~7 iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Integration in Loops\n",
    "- **AI as Validator:** LLM judges guesses without hardcoded logic\n",
    "- **Dynamic Feedback:** Agent provides natural language reasoning\n",
    "- **Reliable Parsing:** Extract structured signals from text responses\n",
    "- **Scalability:** Same pattern works for complex decision-making\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Streaming in Loops\n",
    "- Track each iteration's executor invocations\n",
    "- Count loop cycles by monitoring specific executor completions\n",
    "- Observe when the workflow becomes idle (loop termination)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loop Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### While-Loop Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Executor maintains condition state\n",
    "@handler\n",
    "async def check_condition(state, ctx):\n",
    "    if condition_met(state):\n",
    "        await ctx.yield_output(result)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        await ctx.send_message(updated_state)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Loop: check → process → check (repeat)\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(process, check).add_edge(check, process)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### For-Loop Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Executor maintains counter\n",
    "@handler\n",
    "async def iterate(state, ctx):\n",
    "    if state.counter < max_iterations:\n",
    "        await ctx.send_message(state.increment())\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        await ctx.yield_output(state.result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retry Pattern\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Loop until success or max retries\n",
    "@handler\n",
    "async def retry_executor(attempt, ctx):\n",
    "    if attempt.success or attempt.count > max_retries:\n",
    "        await ctx.yield_output(attempt)\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        await ctx.send_message(attempt.retry())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices for Loops\n",
    "- **Always have termination conditions** to prevent infinite loops\n",
    "- **Use enums** for clear state transitions\n",
    "- **Maintain state in executor instances** for complex loop logic\n",
    "- **Track iteration counts** for debugging and monitoring\n",
    "- **Test with small ranges** before scaling to large iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Explore `edge_condition.ipynb` for conditional branching (if/else)\n",
    "- See `switch_case_edge_group.ipynb` for multi-way branching\n",
    "- Check `multi_selection_edge_group.ipynb` for parallel execution patterns"
