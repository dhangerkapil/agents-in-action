    "# Edge Condition - Conditional Routing with Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates **conditional routing** in workflows using edge conditions. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Attach boolean predicates to edges for if/else routing logic\n",
    "- Use Pydantic models for structured agent outputs (JSON validation)\n",
    "- Implement spam classification with conditional handling\n",
    "- Transform agent responses between workflow stages\n",
    "- Route based on data inspection rather than hardcoded paths\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Sample Does\n",
    "The workflow implements an **email triage system** with conditional routing:\n",
    "1. **spam_detection_agent** - Analyzes email, returns `DetectionResult` (JSON)\n",
    "2. **Conditional Routing:**\n",
    "   - **If NOT spam** → Transform to `AgentExecutorRequest` → `email_assistant_agent` → Draft reply\n",
    "   - **If spam** → `handle_spam_classifier_response` → Block email\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Email text (from `resources/email.txt`)  \n",
    "**Output:** Either drafted reply OR spam notice (based on classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Edge Conditions:** Predicate functions that inspect messages to decide routing\n",
    "- **Pydantic Models:** Type-safe structured outputs (`DetectionResult`, `EmailResponse`)\n",
    "- **Response Format:** `response_format` parameter forces LLMs to return valid JSON\n",
    "- **Transformer Executors:** Convert between data types (response → request)\n",
    "- **Defensive Parsing:** Handle parse errors gracefully to avoid dead ends"

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Routing Pattern\n",
    "✅ **Edge Conditions:** Predicates inspect messages to decide routing  \n",
    "✅ **If/Else Logic:** `condition=get_condition(False)` vs `condition=get_condition(True)`  \n",
    "✅ **Data-Driven Routing:** Decisions based on message content, not hardcoded paths  \n",
    "✅ **Multiple Paths:** Same upstream executor can route to different downstreams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structured Outputs with Pydantic\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Type Safety:** Catch schema mismatches at parse time\n",
    "- **Validation:** Automatic field validation (types, required fields)\n",
    "- **IDE Support:** Autocomplete and type hints\n",
    "- **Documentation:** Models serve as schema documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "1. Define Pydantic models (`DetectionResult`, `EmailResponse`)\n",
    "2. Pass to agent: `response_format=DetectionResult`\n",
    "3. LLM returns JSON matching the schema\n",
    "4. Parse safely: `model_validate_json(response.text)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformer Executors\n",
    "**Purpose:** Convert between data types to bridge executors\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** `to_email_assistant_request`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Input: AgentExecutorResponse (DetectionResult JSON)\n",
    "# Output: AgentExecutorRequest (new user message)\n",
    "detection = DetectionResult.model_validate_json(response.text)\n",
    "user_msg = ChatMessage(Role.USER, text=detection.email_content)\n",
    "await ctx.send_message(AgentExecutorRequest(messages=[user_msg], should_respond=True))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common Transformations:**\n",
    "- Response → Request (chain agents)\n",
    "- Structured → Primitive (extract fields)\n",
    "- Primitive → Structured (wrap in models)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defensive Programming\n",
    "**Avoid Dead Ends:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if not isinstance(message, AgentExecutorResponse):\n",
    "    return True  # Let edge pass to avoid workflow stalling\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fail-Closed on Errors:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    detection = DetectionResult.model_validate_json(response.text)\n",
    "    return detection.is_spam == expected_result\n",
    "except Exception:\n",
    "    return False  # Don't route on parse errors\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Routing Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Decision (If/Else)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(classifier, path_a, condition=lambda msg: msg.category == 'A')\n",
    "workflow.add_edge(classifier, path_b, condition=lambda msg: msg.category == 'B')\n",

    "1. `spam_detection_agent` receives email\n",
    "2. Returns `DetectionResult(is_spam=False, reason=\"...\", email_content=\"...\")`\n",
    "3. `get_condition(False)` evaluates to `True` → routes to transformer\n",
    "4. `to_email_assistant_request` extracts `email_content`, creates new request\n",
    "5. `email_assistant_agent` drafts reply\n",
    "6. `handle_email_response` parses `EmailResponse`, yields output\n",

    "### Spam Path:\n",
    "1. `spam_detection_agent` receives email\n",
    "2. Returns `DetectionResult(is_spam=True, reason=\"Suspicious content\", ...)`\n",
    "3. `get_condition(True)` evaluates to `True` → routes to spam handler\n",
    "4. `handle_spam_classifier_response` yields spam notice\n",

    "## Best Practices\n",
    "- **Use Pydantic models** for agent outputs to ensure type safety\n",
    "- **Set `response_format`** to enforce structured JSON from LLMs\n",
    "- **Handle parse errors** gracefully in condition functions\n",
    "- **Validate executor inputs** with type checks and assertions\n",
    "- **Provide fallback paths** to prevent workflow deadlocks\n",
    "- **Keep conditions simple** - complex logic belongs in executors\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- See `switch_case_edge_group.ipynb` for cleaner multi-way routing\n",
    "- Explore `multi_selection_edge_group.ipynb` for parallel branching (fan-out)\n",
    "- Check `simple_loop.ipynb` for iterative patterns with feedback loops"
