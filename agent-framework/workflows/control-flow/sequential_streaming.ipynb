    "# Sequential Streaming - Function-Based Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build sequential workflows using **function-based executors** with the `@executor` decorator. You'll learn how to:\n",
    "- Use `@executor` decorator to create lightweight executors from functions\n",
    "- Build the same transformation pipeline as `sequential_executors.ipynb` with less boilerplate\n",
    "- Stream workflow events for observability\n",
    "- Compare class-based vs. function-based executor patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Sample Does\n",
    "The workflow performs the same text transformation pipeline as the class-based version:\n",
    "1. **to_upper_case** - Converts input text to uppercase\n",
    "2. **reverse_text** - Reverses the uppercase text\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** `\"hello world\"`  \n",
    "**Output:** `\"DLROW OLLEH\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from Class-Based Pattern\n",
    "- **Less Boilerplate:** No need to create classes or `__init__` methods\n",
    "- **Functional Style:** Simple functions decorated with `@executor`\n",
    "- **Same Capabilities:** Full access to `WorkflowContext` and all framework features\n",
    "- **Best for:** Stateless transformations and simple logic"

    "\n",
    "### Class-Based Executors\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class UpperCaseExecutor(Executor):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, id: str | None = None):\n",
    "        super().__init__(id=id or \"upper_case_executor\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @handler\n",
    "    async def to_upper_case(self, text: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:\n",
    "        upper_text = text.upper()\n",
    "        await ctx.send_message(upper_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-Based Executors\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@executor(id=\"to_upper_case\")\n",
    "async def to_upper_case(text: str, ctx: WorkflowContext[str]) -> None:\n",
    "    upper_text = text.upper()\n",
    "    await ctx.send_message(upper_text)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lines of code:** ~8 lines → ~4 lines (50% reduction)\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Function-Based (`@executor`) When:\n",
    "✅ Executor logic is stateless (no instance variables)  \n",
    "✅ Simple transformations or data processing  \n",
    "✅ You want minimal boilerplate  \n",
    "✅ Single-purpose executors  \n",
    "✅ Quick prototyping or scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Class-Based (`Executor`) When:\n",
    "✅ Need to maintain state across invocations  \n",
    "✅ Require initialization parameters  \n",
    "✅ Multiple handler methods or helper functions  \n",
    "✅ Complex business logic  \n",
    "✅ Reusable components across workflows  \n",
    "✅ Need lifecycle methods (setup, teardown)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function-Based Advantages\n",
    "- **Conciseness:** 50% less code for simple executors\n",
    "- **Readability:** Clear intent without class structure overhead\n",
    "- **Simplicity:** No need to understand class inheritance\n",
    "- **Same Power:** Full access to `WorkflowContext` and all framework features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution Flow\n",
    "The execution flow is **identical** to the class-based version:\n",
    "1. Input `\"hello world\"` → `to_upper_case`\n",
    "2. `to_upper_case` transforms to `\"HELLO WORLD\"` → sends message\n",
    "3. `reverse_text` receives `\"HELLO WORLD\"` → reverses to `\"DLROW OLLEH\"`\n",
    "4. `reverse_text` yields final output\n",
    "\n",
    "### Event Streaming\n",
    "Both patterns support the same event streaming capabilities:\n",
    "- `ExecutorInvokedEvent` - Executor starts\n",
    "- `ExecutorCompletedEvent` - Executor finishes\n",
    "- `WorkflowOutputEvent` - Final result\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "- Start with function-based executors for simplicity\n",
    "- Migrate to class-based when you need state or complexity\n",
    "- Mix both patterns in the same workflow (they're fully compatible)\n",
    "- Use meaningful executor IDs for debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "- Compare with `sequential_executors.ipynb` to see the class-based version\n",
    "- Explore `edge_condition.ipynb` for conditional routing\n",
    "- See `multi_selection_edge_group.ipynb` for parallel branching"
