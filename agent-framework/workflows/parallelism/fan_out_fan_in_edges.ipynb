    "This notebook demonstrates advanced **fan-out and fan-in patterns** using **AgentExecutor** to coordinate multiple AI agents working in parallel on the same task from different domain perspectives.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Agent Parallelization\n",
    "- **Multiple AI agents** process the same prompt simultaneously\n",
    "- Each agent specializes in a different domain (research, marketing, legal)\n",
    "- **AgentExecutor** integrates Azure OpenAI for LLM-powered processing\n",
    "- Results are consolidated into a unified report\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fan-Out with Target Routing\n",
    "- `AgentExecutorRequest` includes `target_id` for agent selection\n",
    "- Dispatcher creates multiple requests, each targeting a specific agent\n",
    "- All agents receive the same prompt but apply domain-specific expertise\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fan-In with Response Aggregation\n",
    "- Collects `list[AgentExecutorResponse]` from all agents\n",
    "- Each response contains agent insights and metadata\n",
    "- Aggregator synthesizes insights into a consolidated report\n",
