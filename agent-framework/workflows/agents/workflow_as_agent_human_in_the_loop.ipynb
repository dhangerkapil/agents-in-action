    "# Workflow as Agent with Human-in-the-Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to wrap a workflow as an agent and implement human escalation patterns. The workflow creates a **Worker-Reviewer** cycle where uncertain decisions are escalated to a human manager for approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **WorkflowAgent**: Wraps a workflow to expose an agent-like interface\n",
    "2. **Human Escalation**: When the reviewer lacks confidence, it escalates to a human\n",
    "3. **Bidirectional Flow**: Worker ↔ Reviewer ↔ RequestInfoExecutor\n",
    "4. **Function Call Protocol**: Human feedback is delivered via `FunctionCallContent` and `FunctionResultContent`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Worker (generates response)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Reviewer (evaluates quality)\n",
    "    ↓ (if uncertain)\n",
    "RequestInfoExecutor (human manager)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Reviewer (receives human decision)\n",
    "    ↓\n",
    "Worker (incorporates feedback if needed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use This Pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Critical decisions requiring human oversight\n",
    "- High-stakes outputs (legal, medical, financial)\n",
    "- Quality assurance workflows\n",
    "- Compliance and approval gates\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- OpenAI API key configured (environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`)\n",
    "- Agent Framework installed: `pip install agent-framework`\n",
    "- Understanding of `WorkflowBuilder`, `Executor`, and message handlers"

    "- Enables composition of complex workflows as reusable building blocks\n",
    "- Exposes standard `run()` and `run_stream()` methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Human Escalation Pattern\n",
    "- `RequestInfoExecutor` provides built-in support for external input\n",
    "- WorkflowAgent exposes `REQUEST_INFO_FUNCTION_NAME` as a function call\n",
    "- Human responses delivered via `FunctionResultContent`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Bidirectional Communication\n",
    "- Worker ↔ Reviewer edges enable iterative refinement\n",
    "- Reviewer can escalate to human or send feedback directly to Worker\n",
    "- Worker regenerates response based on feedback until approved\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Message Type Design\n",
    "- `HumanReviewRequest` extends `RequestInfoMessage` for escalation\n",
    "- `ReviewResponse` carries approval decision and feedback\n",
    "- Strong typing ensures correct handler matching\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Production Considerations\n",
    "- Add confidence scoring to determine when escalation is needed\n",
    "- Implement timeout/retry logic for human responses\n",
    "- Log escalation events for audit trails\n",
    "- Consider async human response handling (webhook callbacks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. When to Use This vs. Automated Review\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Critical decisions, compliance gates, low confidence scenarios\n",
    "- **Automated Review**: High-throughput, well-defined criteria, sufficient training data"
